# Marketing Engineer · Skill (English)

Turn marketing into an engineering system: **knowledge layer → business lines → ticket pipeline → human sign-off → data feedback loop**, plus a single-file **dashboard** you can open anytime.
No inspiration-driven content piles. Reusable structure makes every output stand on verified facts and fixed voice/brand rules.

Methodology credit: Shann Holmberg ([@shannholmberg](https://x.com/shannholmberg)) — *Marketing Engineer* (the X thread "this is my AI marketing engine" and the article *How to Become a Marketing Engineer*, with four building blocks: Context / Loops / Graphs / Harness). This project is the engineering practice and productization built on top of that theory.

---

## What it solves

AI can already write and design. What really breaks is three other things:

| Problem | How this fixes it |
|---|---|
| **Context drift**: the voice you set today wanders off in three days | A single citable `shared-knowledge/` pack of five files + the hard rule "no source, no writing" |
| **Standards not persisted**: every review made up on the spot = no standard | Protocols written into files (glossary, domain rules, pre-publish checklist); machine audits, humans only judge taste |
| **State invisible**: dozens of files, no idea which is at what stage | Single-file dashboard: left tree / right file list, date + status + click-to-read |

## 30-second start

After install, **no commands**. You talk, it runs:

```
"Build a marketing workspace for product X, with dashboard"
"Show me the overall status"
"Content updated, refresh the dashboard"
"Published this on WeChat, link is xxx"
```

Agent-side actions (normally run automatically by the agent; commands left for your cron or troubleshooting):

| Your intent | Script it runs |
|---|---|
| Build workspace | `scripts/init_workspace.py <dir> --product "<product>" --with-dashboard` |
| See overview | `scripts/serve_dashboard.py <workspace> 8799` → <http://127.0.0.1:8799/dashboard.html> |
| Refresh snapshot | `scripts/build_dashboard.py <workspace>` |
| Re-scan only | `scripts/scan_workspace.py <workspace>` |

## Install

```bash
# Option 1: clone then copy into skills dir
git clone https://github.com/iguoguo/marketing-engineer.git
cp -r marketing-engineer ~/.workbuddy/skills/

# Option 2: download zip (no git)
# https://github.com/iguoguo/marketing-engineer/releases/download/v1.0.0/marketing-engineer-skill.zip
```

Only dependency is Python 3 (standard library), no third-party packages.

## Workspace after build

└── dashboard.html             # single-file dashboard, double-click to view
```

## Dashboard

- **Left tree / right file list**: folder notes appear once on the left; every file clickable (Markdown render, tables, code copy, image preview)
- **Status isn't guessed**: manual registry → publish ledger hit → file header `> 状态：待审核` → folder-rule fallback, four-level judgment
- **Two update modes**: realtime (local server, re-scans each open) / manual (rebuild static snapshot, works offline)
- **Light / Dark themes**; any `<section id="tab-xxx">` auto-becomes a Tab

## Eight iron rules (never violate)

1. **Read before write**: must check `shared-knowledge/` before output; never fabricate channels, data, features
2. **Evidence trail**: facts carry source + date; unverified marked `[unverified]`, never into final
3. **Publish needs human approval**: ledger follows the actually-published online version
4. **Voice consistency**: terms / domains / free-tier wording uniform across channels; change triggers audit (internal board included)
5. **Secrets only in `.env`**, never in any asset or doc
6. **Output in place**: drafts / final / ledger stored per folder convention
7. **Sensitive boundary**: no named competitor disparagement; no concrete prices before pricing finalized
8. **Board is a view, not the source**: derived from ledger / tickets / channel table, never reversed as truth source

## Who builds & runs it (brand note)

This skill is authored and battle-tested by two practitioners:

- **2Ryun (Second Reality)** — an AI-native knowledge base & content-infrastructure platform. This methodology is the productized form of how 2Ryun runs its own marketing and helps teams turn scattered knowledge into publishable, SEO/GEO-optimized assets. English site: [2ryun.com](https://2ryun.com). Tagline: *"SEO into search + GEO into AI retrieval."* Free to use.
- **Shandong Dizan Culture (山东迪赞文化)** — a B2B marketing agency serving small and mid-sized businesses; 8 years in operation, 50+ clients across 6 industries. The ticket pipeline, GEO playbook, and dashboard in this skill are proven in its client-delivery work.

> Using this skill does not require either product. It is a standalone methodology you can apply to any workspace.

## Known boundaries

- If you only publish one post and don't plan to keep producing, don't install — cost is in startup, payoff is in compounding
- Empty knowledge layer → output immediately drops to generic AI level
- Dashboard is a view not a source; at thousands of files, reset snapshot budget
